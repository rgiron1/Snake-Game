# Snake-
Creates the game Snake in the console
## Version 1.0.0

__The goal of the game is to collect as many fruits as possible without hitting your tail or a wall. The player uses the arrow keys to control the head of the snake. As you collect more fruit, your tail size will increase. The head of the snake is an "O" and the fruits are "*". When the game ends, the program will immediately end.__

 _My next goal is to build and actual GUI for the game_

### Bugs
* There is an input delay
* Small minor bugs regarding wall hit detection
